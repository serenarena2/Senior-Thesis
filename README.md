Conducted research on sustainable development variables and measured their effect on economic growth using a panel regression model. 

The purpose of this project is to understand how nations measure their success and whether these
measures are enough to satisfy both the needs of the economy as well as the natural world. The
goal of sustainable development is to promote prosperity, end poverty, and protect the
environment, with a focus on continuing to develop while minimizing waste and harm. On an
international level, there is great urgency and cooperation needed for our future generations to be
able to flourish on Earth. The aim of this study is to use indicators that establish a measurement
for sustainable development that can be used proxy for a countryâ€™s progress. Further measuring
sustainable development against economic growth will help us better understand how these
indicators effect economic growth in a finite world. This study used programs Python and R to run
a statistical regression analysis on panel data and found that sustainable development does indeed
affect GDP per capita and concluded that a one unit increase in the Gini Index, ceteris paribus, will
lead to a 1.715% decrease in economic growth.
