Conducted research on sustainable development variables and measured their effect on economic growth using a panel regression model. 

The purpose of this project is to understand how nations measure their success and whether these
measures are enough to satisfy both the needs of the economy as well as the natural world. The aim of this study is to use indicators that establish a measurement
for sustainable development that can be used proxy for a countryâ€™s progress. Further measuring
sustainable development against economic growth will help us better understand how these
indicators effect economic growth in a finite world. This study used programs Python and R to run
a statistical regression analysis on panel data and found that sustainable development does indeed
affect GDP per capita. The results of this study is that, sustainable development accounts for
approximately 37.3% of GDP per capita. It also concluded that a one unit increase in the Gini Index, ceteris paribus, will lead to a 1.715% decrease in economic growth. Further, the unemployment indicator is a percentage of the total labor force, the results can be interpreted as a one percent increase in unemployment will lead to a
2.47% decrease in GDP per capita.
